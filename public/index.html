        tongue like pearls, <br>
        port to port they go on plying<br>
        beneath the haunt, <br>
        the bridge lights<br><br>

        are joined in their reflection <br>
        by the molar white mourning <br>
        of moon coaxing the sea<br>
        out from itself, the fog<br>
        into my lungs. my face ripples<br>
        where you cast your stones. <br>
        we prophesize the end coming as snowfall,<br>
        opaline against pastel light<br><br>

        all my runs are smooth now, athletic as<br>
        a jazz tune. You hold me the way<br>
        white light collects color.<br>
        Is color. Gives color <br>

      I am a child of hope <br> 
      a child of the Mojave desert,<br> 
      the prickly pear, waxy cactus that holds<br> 
      onto two pearls of rain <br>
      to make its living,<br> 
      the xerophyte fighting,<br> 
      for years yearning, enduring<br> 
      the photons streaming<br> 
      down from the Arizona sun<br> <br> 

      windfalls of dust pattern my skin in<br> 
      logo syllables forming your name and<br> 
      your name and your name<br> <br> 

      storm though you were,<br> 
      when will you return? <br> 
      the wind answers, bringing <br> 
      in fox bones to kiss <br> 
      for the loneliness<br> <br> 

      my spine aches into needles<br> 
      keeps out the wrens of refuge,<br> 
      I can’t do anything but survive the heat, <br> 
      rooted here, my whole biology built <br> 
      for beating back everything except you<br> <br> 

      I fork into beauty<br> 
      an array of orange flowers to charm <br> 
      the severe and remaining gods <br>
      of this wasteland, to say to them:<br>
      we’ve been sparing, limited --<br> 
      spent the warm springs in wait. <br> 
      why shouldn’t we greet each other<br> 
      now with our gifts? <br> <br> 

      I bloom and bust, <br> 
      launching my demands to <br> 
      the sparing sky and<br> 
      wait for you,<br> 
      rain that may never come<br>

      if not now, when? <br>
      sure, there is always later <br>
      but later always comes as the carcinoma <br>
      pent up in the genome, an amassed fury <br>
      threatening to overthrow <br>
      the cathedral of body. <br>
      how do you plan to answer the problem <br><br>

      of body if not by throwing ours<br>
      against each other? we roughhouse <br>
      playing pain, and then repent by crushing<br>
      lavender between our palms to be pretty <br><br>

      again, to hear the psalm of the flower<br>
      release its notes of perfume and<br>
      pardon us for our minor cruelties.<br><br>

      meanwhile the mist drops low <br>
      and hangs unblinking like a bright eye <br>
      over Pier 49. an angler snares a fin<br>
      larger than himself, reels it in, and<br>
      desiccates under the weight <br>
      of his lovely Leviathan<br>
      while it hammers to return to the ocean<br><br>

      the way that the Mother praying<br>
      mantis, now with her child in view,<br>
      is the widow and the widow<br><br>

      maker, the Taker of Heads. <br>
      her procreation ritual --<br>
      her prayer, is a green fluttering,<br>
      green wrestling of green wings,<br><br>

      even the original sweetness comes <br>
      with a price, but still I open <br>
      the door for you –<br>
      the door to splendor <br>
      must remain ajar at all costs<br>

      have you looked at the blood moon <br>
      long enough to find the sun <br>
      after the eclipse? <br><br>

      have you been in the house<br>
      while the crook sneaks back out, <br>
      stealing nothing but a few<br>
      moments from himself?<br><br>
      
      the basement of memory needs <br>
      to be pried open with a crowbar<br>
      and fumigated. but if you do this, <br>
      not inconsequential labor,<br>
      shed a little weight for<br>
      the algorithms of maintenance:<br><br>

      I’m listening to you now, <br>
      but also the rain <br>
      as it particalizes against glass<br>
      as it meters and mumbles old philosophy <br>
      of how things fallen are often reskied.<br><br>

      I’m listening to you as I slice an apple,<br>
      split it cleanly into two perfect halves <br>
      that happily yield their seeds <br><br>

      I’m listening to you, wanting <br>
      of this symmetry, <br>
      as in the divides of pain, symmetry <br>
      is never guaranteed<br><br>

      I’m listening to you over <br>
      the wanting of the metal earth <br>
      and its spinning magnetic core <br>
      that breaks up our line <br><br>

      I’m listening to you, down on all luck,<br>
      when you tell me that our gazes surely <br>
      meet on the face of the same moon<br>
